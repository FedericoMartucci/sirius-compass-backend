# Project Backlog & Technical Debt

## High Priority (MVP Refinements)
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering**: Refine the `analyze_activities_node` system prompt.
    - current issue: The agent is too sycophantic/nice.
    - goal: It needs to be a strict auditor detecting Spanish comments, mixed languages, and bad practices.
- [ ] **Structured Output**: Replace manual JSON mocking in `generate_report_node`.
    - goal: Use `llm.with_structured_output(PydanticModel)` to ensure the score and skills are real data generated by the LLM, not placeholders.

## Future Improvements
- [ ] **Dynamic RAG**: Currently using static rules. Need to implement a retrieval node to fetch specific rules based on the file type (e.g., fetch React rules only for .jsx files).
- [ ] **Graph Complexity**: Split `analyze_activities_node` into `retrieve_context` -> `analyze_diffs` -> `synthesize_findings`.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Improve exception handling in Adapters (retry logic for API limits).
